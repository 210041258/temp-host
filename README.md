# my admin gateway : 

----------


####  ***offers the principle of the p-p approach of the security the pin will be requested for each one of them but the question will be from where that pin will be gernerated , assume that we have 5 people will be getting in inside my webpage*** 


----------


#### 1- the view of the working will be a request the same session order to mydb 

#### 2- now that pin can be accessible by the one person in the android admin gui view in the application after passing the condition situation as admin which is limited which the system admin with one email 

#### 3- as human simulation brain will say that can't be , now if they hack the db fireabse that will be the breaking of the system of the admin gateway becuase thats the only case to cut the connection

> (note) no wories also i will work with one course i will apply ti nearly "distrubtued db", and also i want to make it but i dont have the time for that ,but when the finsihing the bsc couress (if there is no another scholarship offered to me (free offer accessable always whaterver it is )) i will desgine the all Architecture with more better views inside each element 


#### 4- now let continue the simulation , there is no one will be accessible to get the access otherwise the admin at that moment , if the can play the role of the 3-if condition that will be the only case to my system to out

#### 5- the gateway after accessing it , you can play the role of the admin as managment things simple like that 

#### 6- managment have a conneciton with all branchs of the user data and interfaces of the applications i provide the photo screenshots for that
